# Finding duplicated code in huge codebases

**This is a WIP article**

I'm currently writing a master thesis at The University of Oslo in Norway. Ever since I
discovered the field of programming languages and compiler technology, I have been
interested in leveraging such technologies in order to improve the quality of my own code.
[As a Neovim user](/blog/posts/modernvim) I have became familiar with technologies such as
[LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and
[tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), which is a pleasure to use in
my daily programming work. For my thesis I wanted to explore the idea of adding more static
analysis tools while editing, leveraging the editor-agnostic aspects of LSP, and the
language agnostic (grammar pluggable) aspects of tree-sitter. The problem I decided to
tackle was detection of duplicate code, otherwise known as code clone detection.

## The problem

To set the stage, the following will be the problem we are trying to solve. 

We want to build a static analysis tool which runs as an LSP server, giving indications to
the programmer that there are code duplicates in their codebase, at a given set of
locations. As the programmer writes, changes or deletes code, we need to be able to react to
those changes, finding or removing code clones from the programmers view as they appear/disappear.

The real challenge with this problem is the algorithmic aspect. We need to process
potentially many MLOC (million lines of code) and we need to do it quickly. This is
impossible to do in real-time, but we have a trick up our sleeves. As the programmer edits
source code, there is only a small portion of code in a single file which is edited at a
time. This means that 99%+ of our codebase and list of clones will probably stay the same after each
edit. If we can incrementally update our list of clones given only the small edit of the
source code, this problem goes from impossible to do quickly, to a realistic, but tough
challenge.


## The algorithm

First we need to parse our source code. We need to do this because we want to extract
certain fragments of our code which will be considered for clone detection.

export default ({ children }) => <PostLayout>{children}</PostLayout>;
