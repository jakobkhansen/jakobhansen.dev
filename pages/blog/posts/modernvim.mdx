# Modern Vim: Neovim in 2022

I have been using Neovim for about 4 years. I started using Neovim during my second
semester of CS studies, and I found the editor to be magical in terms of how I could
express how I want to edit code in Vim's own "language", which felt very ergonomic. It
certainly improved my text editing speed and comfort, but what's the point of talking
about Vim in 2022? Most editors far outperform Vim with tooling, extensions and generally
better language support, right?

Enter Neovim, a fork of Vim which was created in 2014, which today is the only reasonable
version of Vim to call "modern".

In this article I will try to make the case that Neovim can rival (and even surpass)
modern editors such as VSCode, and giving a high-level overview of the current plugin
ecosystem which Neovim users should be aware of.

## Neovim: batteries not included

I want to preface this by saying that Neovim is an extendable editor. Terms such as
[Personalized Development Environment](https://youtu.be/QMVIJhC9Veg) has been coined which
puts Neovim closer to Emacs in how you would extend and personalize your editor.

Extensibility runs in the Neovim communities veins, and you cannot expect to have a
VSCode-experience in Neovim without setting up some plugins.

_My Neovim_

[My config](https://github.com/jakobkhansen/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim) is a purely
Lua, modular config, with ~40 plugins. That may sound like a lot of plugins, but most
Neovim plugins are pretty minimal. A typical plugin would for example only implement a new
motion, or add som Git information to the buffer, and many of these are features which are
probably baked into your regular editor. The difference however comes in how you build up
your config and compose these plugins and features into the ultimate editor for you.

One way that I have personalized my editor is that I have focused on having a very minimal
interface and removing information which I do not need to look at often. I usually only
have two windows open in a split, and no status-line, instead having hotkeys available
which show me the information that I would usually put in my status-line (Git branch, cwd,
...). File-tree, fuzzy-finder and terminal is just a hotkey away, but I rarely keep those
visible all the time.

Let's look at file-navigation as an example on how you can personalize a workflow. Most
modern editor would probably force you to use a regular file-tree. There is nothing wrong
with using a that, but Neovim doesn't force you into using one if something better fits
your workflow. A good file-tree plugin is
[Neo-tree](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim), but if you would want to have
more of a fuzzy-finding experience,
[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is fantastic. Other good
options for file-navigation is [FZF](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua),
[fm-nvim](https://github.com/is0n/fm-nvim) or even just using the built-in Vim commands
and the built-in Netrw navigator.

With this kind of angle, comparing a full-fledged IDE like IntelliJ to Neovim is similar
to the [Composition vs
inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) idea. Neovim
obviously prefers composition, as more advanced functionality and language-specific
tooling is achieved from composition of many smaller plugins. An IDE like IntelliJ and its
offsprings is more of an inheritance based text-editor, where language specific-tooling
comes from a "subclass" of IntelliJ (PyCharm, CLion). In practice, I see the
composition-based approach to editing features as a lot more flexible for the average
programmer, if you ever want to add support for a new language in Neovim, just plug in or
write an LSP server and maybe write a small plugin, the rest of the fantastic plugin
ecosystem will do the rest for you.

## Lua and the new Neovim plugin ecosystem

Neovim's plugin ecosystem entered a sort of renaissance period when Lua was introduced as
an embedded plugin and configuration language in the 0.5 update. Lua is a much nicer
language to work with than Vimscript, which was the previous language one would use to
write Vim plugins. For reference, here is some code which can be used to open up a
"popup-terminal" at the bottom of the viewport in Neovim:

```lua
function P.openPopupTerminal(cmd)
    vim.cmd("bot 15sp")

    local popUpWindow = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
    local popUpBuffer = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)

    vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(popUpWindow, popUpBuffer)

    local on_exit = function()
        vim.api.nvim_buf_delete(popUpBuffer, { force = true })
        vim.api.nvim_win_close(popUpWindow, true)
        lastOpenedTerminalJobId = nil
    end

    vim.api.nvim_command("startinsert")
    lastOpenedTerminalJobId = vim.fn.termopen(cmd or vim.o.shell, {
        on_exit = on_exit,
    })
end
```

Lua is a flexible scripting language, allowing procedural, object-oriented and
functional programming techniques to work hand in hand to quickly iterate on plugins. Combine
this with the well-defined and well-documented API's that Neovim provides to interact with the
editor, and it's not hard to see why this was a big success.

In my opinion, Lua has made both writing plugins and using plugins more flexible, it's easy
to give users of your plugin the ability to extend your plugin by allowing them to for
example run a custom callback when a certain event in your plugin happens.

There are now dozens of plugins for Neovim which are very high quality and extendable,
here are some of my favorites:

- [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) - Plugin-manager with great lazy-loading and GUI
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) - Must-have fuzzy-finder
- [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) - Note-taking and organization
- [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) - Extensible auto-completion framework
- [Mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) - Small utility plugins
- [Copilot.lua](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua) - Copilot auto-completion
- [journal.nvim](https://github.com/jakobkhansen/journal.nvim) - My own journaling plugin

## LSP

The Language Server Protocol is a godsend for people who use unconventional editors which
doesn't necessarily have the backing of a huge community or company. Those who use more
popular editors might be thinking "This is cool, but is there any tooling support for x
language?", that's where LSP comes in.

LSP is a protocol which defines how a language tooling server and a client should
communicate. If the client wants to get auto-completions while typing, the interaction
would look something like this:

```txt
┌────────────────┐Give me completions!┌────────────────┐
│                ├───────────────────►│                │
│     Client     │                    │     Server     │
│    (Neovim)    │◄───────────────────┤   (tsserver)   │
└────────────────┘    Completion[]    └────────────────┘
```

This kind of interaction allows the client to ask for a lot of different things, such as
error-messages (diagnostics), go-to-definition, auto-completion and even generic
"code-actions", which allows advanced commands to be run. An example of this would be the
Java language-server, which allows the user to run an "extract-method" code-action.

## Treesitter

Finally, Tree-sitter is a language-agnostic incremental-parser generator. In layman's terms it's a
very fast parser which can analyze the structure of our programs. This gives us constant
access to an AST-structure (Abstract syntax-tree) which we can analyze and do
transformations on.

[Tree-sitter for Neovim](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) is used for
syntax highlighting, but is very extensible for users and plugin authors as well.

The AST allows us to create [syntactically aware
motions](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects) like pressing
`daf` to delete an entire function. These motions are configurable, and rely only on the
tree-sitter AST nodes, so anyone could write a new motion which selects something random
like an if-clause or a loop-initialization.

Another usage of tree-sitter is to write transformations which allow us to do [simple
refactorings](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/refactoring.nvim). This plugin uses Neovim's
tree-sitter API to move around nodes in the AST and thereby transforming our source-code
by moving code around with a good guarantee that the syntactic integrity of our program is
conserved (since we are moving AST nodes around, not text). Refactoring such as moving
function parameters, extracting functions and a lot more become way easier with
tree-sitter.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this article has shown that Neovim and terminal editors in general can still be
top-contendors in terms of features for developers. Neovim already has a lot of benefits
by being a lightweight terminal editor and very ergonomic motion-system, so if you are
able to craft the rest of the features you need into your own personalized experience,
this is a seriously powerful tool for any developer.
