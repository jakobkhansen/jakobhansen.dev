## Microsoft

After completing my masters thesis, I started working at Microsoft in the fall of 2023,
where I had interned the summer before. I joined the People Experiences group where I have
worked on several different products which are integrated in the M365 ecosystem. I've
worked primarily on front-end development using React and Typescript, but I've also
dabbled in .NET development when needed. The products I've worked on are used by hundreds
of millions users worldwide and are some of the most essential features in the M365
ecosystem.

Another component of my work has been more targeted towards infrastructure and testing. I
was part of a team that migrated an existing product from using the Apollo GraphQL
library, to Relay, following the [Nova pattern](https://github.com/microsoft/nova-facade/).
With that, I took the initiative to write some of the infrastructure to test and write
storybooks for our components. This has now become a part of the nova-facade repo
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/nova-facade/tree/main/packages/nova-react-test-utils)
