## Teaching assistant at UiO

In 2020 I started working as a teaching assistant at UiO. I decided to do this because I
love talking about and teaching programming and specifically algorithms and datastructures
to other people.

I TA'ed in the following courses:

- Fall 2020: Algorithms and datastructures
- Spring 2021: Object-oriented programming
- Fall 2021: Algorithms and datastructures
- Spring 2022: Intro to object-oriented programing
- Fall 2022: Algorithms and datastructures

For the algorithms and datastructures course I was actively working to create a
competitive-programming environment at UiO. This involved hosting contests and showing
students how they could get started on platforms such as Kattis.

For the fall of 2020 I was awarded the "most engagement from TA" prize by the student
administration.
