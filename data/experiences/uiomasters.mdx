## Master's degree at UiO

I finished my master's degree at UiO in 2023. My thesis explored the problem of finding
duplicated code in large codebases for usage in editors. Read more about it
[here](/blog/posts/masterthesis).

During my master's degree I completed courses on topics such as:

- Compilers and static analysis
- Concurrency models
- Platform ecosystems
- Software testing
- Security

I finished my master's degree with only A grades, including the thesis itself.
