# Bekk internship

For the summer of 2021, I worked at Bekk Consulting, where I was a technical consultant for
Wenn, an AI startup with a focus on computer vision services on cars.

We were tasked with improving their computer vision services by handling and processing a large
amount of data, for usage in training machine-learning models.

To generate and process data we used Python, Pandas and PIL, and worked with AWS services such
as S3 and EC2
