## Master's degree at UiO

I am currently completing a master's degree at UiO. My thesis is solving the problem of
finding duplicated code in large codebases for usage in editors. Read more about it
[here](/blog/posts/masterthesis).

During my master's degree I took courses on topics such as:

- Compilers and static analysis
- Concurrency models
- Platform ecosystems
- Software testing
- Security

I will finish my master's degree with an average grade of A.
