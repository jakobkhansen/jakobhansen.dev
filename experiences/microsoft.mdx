## Microsoft internship

For the summer of 2022 I interned at Microsoft in their Oslo office. For close to three
months I was working as a full-time front-end engineer on the "People experiences"
products which is shipped in various Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Teams.

The main feature I worked on was a part of the "profile card" where one could browse an
organization-hierarchy, seeing who reports to who and quickly navigating between people in
the same team.

I implemented this feature for Mobile and MacOS platforms, utilizing React Native with
Typescript.
